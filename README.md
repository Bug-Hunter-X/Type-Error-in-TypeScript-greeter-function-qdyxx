# Type Error in TypeScript greeter function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.

The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts to pass an array to a function expecting a string. This results in a type error.

The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates how to fix the error by either changing the function signature to accept an array or by modifying the function to handle the array input appropriately.
